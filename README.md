An homage to Star Raiders played from the vantage point of the Zylons.

This is a personal project which serves as a tribute to the greatest game ever written, Star Raiders. While the first-person space combat simlulator space has seen many impressive efforts over the years (Elite, Wing Commander, Freespace, Star Citizen) since Doug Neubauer first single-handedly created it in 1979, few have been able to duplicate the perfect balance of strategy and twitch gaming fun that made the original so much fun, and such an impressive work of art. 

This project attempts to address that vaccum, using a modern mobile platform to provide a new generation of gamers a glimpse into what made Star Raiders such an important part of videogame history. In it, you once again play a pilot defending against a merciless onslaught of invading aliens - only this time, it's the Humons who are attacking, and the Zylons you are helping to defend their home world.

Despite the reversal of perspective, Zylon Raiders aims to evoke the gameplay style of a bygone era, taking advantage of modern platform to allow the sorts of bells and whistles which would have been impossible on an 8-bit platform with 8 k of RAM. Amongst these is your artificially intelligent copilot, Kohai, a 3-D galactic map

This is also a project I use to explore interesting iOS frameworks, technologies, or programming techniques. The latest
of these is MultiPeer Connectivity, which allows a second iOS device to control the Zylon ship, and introduce gameplay elements to challenge the primary player in much the same way a dungeonmaster might throw challenges at his adventurers.

Others include SceneKit (used for the lion's share of game mechanics) and Spritekit (used for "HUD" display and other interactive 2D graphic elements). Persistent store for the gamestate will be managed by Coredata.

Special thanks to Lorenz Wiest for reverse-engineering and commenting the original Star Raiders sourcecode, without whose efforts I would have been unlikely to duplicate the swarming behavior of Zylon (in my case, Humon) ships.
