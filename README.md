# ZylonDefenders
An homage to Star Raiders played from the vantage point of the Zylons.

This is a personal project which serves as an homage to the greatest game ever written, Star Raiders. 
It's generally a project I use to explore intersting frameworks, technologies, or programming techniques. The latest
of these is MultiPeerConnectivity, which allows a second iOS device to control the Zylon ship.
