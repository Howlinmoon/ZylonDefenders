An homage to Star Raiders played from the vantage point of the Zylons.

This is a personal project which serves as a tribute to the greatest game ever written, Star Raiders. 
It's also a project I use to explore interesting frameworks, technologies, or programming techniques. The latest
of these is MultiPeerConnectivity, which allows a second iOS device to control the Zylon ship. 

Others include SceneKit (used for the lion's share of game mechanics) and Spritekit (used for "HUD" display and other interactive 2D graphic elements). Persistent store for the gamestate will be managed by Coredata.
